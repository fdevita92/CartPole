# CartPole
Deep Reinforcement Learning applied on AI gym Cartpole environment

To test just type on your command line: python3 dqn_cartpole.py test (it will use the latest weights contained inside the model directory).

Be careful if you wanto to retrain the model. For the moment i suggest you to first move the weights contained inside the model directory into another one and then type: python3 dqn_cartpole.py train.
